This is a sample to demonstrate the features of the TODO list

[ ] This item has not been completed
[?] This item might be done, but we're not sure.
[x] This item is definitely done.

The coloring is based on what's in between the square brackets,
and updates instantly.

Also, if you want to mention some person, put a squiggle before
their name, like this: ~Jim.

Enjoy using Corfu TODO Lists!!
