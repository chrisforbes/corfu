WORK IN PROGRESS
================

The XmlIde-experimental tree is in no way "stable". It is currently in the middle of 
massive restructuring, with the following goals (among others) in mind:

DONE - Removing legacy language service DLL support

DONE - Removing broken "Project Browser" support

DONE - Removing unused completion support (XML was the only language to use it)

DONE - Replacing 1.1.x - 1.2.x language support with a simpler but much more powerful system

- Updating the codebase to use C# 3.0 and .NET 3.5 features

- Replacing the document backend with a gapbuffer+linebuffer system, which allows
  linear addressing within the document, and much simpler editing.
  
- Adding scope selectors for GUI elements, so we can have language-specific UI

- Replacing slow (and glitchy) GDI+ renderer with a fast pure GDI renderer

- Replacing XML with more expressive DSLs for configuration
